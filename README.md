# boot-ext [![Build Status][badge]][build]


Extensions to boot.

For now these include

* keybase based signing support (requires working keybase)
* (experimental) bill of materialsm

# Show me how

## Use keybase.io for signing

(keybase)(https://keybase.io) must be installed for this to work!
For OSx type `brew install keybase` and also install (GPGTools)(https://gpgtools.org). For other systems please
check (here)(https://keybase.io/download).

```clojure

# project's build.boot

# Add to the dependency map
'[instilled/boot-ext "0.0.1-SNAPSHOT" :scope "test"]

(require '[instilled.boot.task :refer [sign-with-keybase]])

(deftask deploy
 []
 (comp
  (sign-with-keybase)
  (push)))

```

This should pop-up the password propt for the signing key.
